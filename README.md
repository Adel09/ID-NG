# ID-NG
App for storing Nigerian government IDs

<h1>App Name: ðŸ†”.NG</h1>
<p>So the initial idea was an all-in-one digital ðŸ†” card app that can digitize all our National ðŸ†” Documents.</p>
<p>The stored ðŸ†”s are supposed to be accessible at all times(stored offline)</p>
<p>It is supposed to have a method of verifying the ðŸ†”s before accepting them into the app but due to KYC regulations, I am not allowed to do that.</p>
<p>So all ðŸ†”s will be stored in a database within the app and a backup will be sent to the cloud.</p>
<p>I've already gone quite far with it.</p>
